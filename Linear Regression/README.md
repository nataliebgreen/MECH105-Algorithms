linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set
inputs:
      x: x-values for our data set
      y: y-values for our data set
Outputs:
      fX: x-values with outliers removed
      fY: y-values with outliers removed
      slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
      intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
      Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
